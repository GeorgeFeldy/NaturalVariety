[c/0EFF0E:Natural Variety] is a new WIP personal project which enhances the game's natural aspects, like: nature, critters, the Zoologist and the Bestiary.

So far it adds:
     QoL Mechanics: 
        Right click to release any critter from a cage (Terrarrium, Bowl, Bottle). 
		See kill count in bestiary: 
		    - Kill count for banners (every 50, needs tally counter or upgrades for the precise count)
		    - Kill count for every variant (needs tally counter)
			- Boss kill count 
	 
     New critters: Flamingoes - pink, white 
     Bird critter variants: Eurasian Jay, Blackbird, Goldfinch, Bee-eater, Kingfisher
     Duck variants: Pochard and Ferruginous Duck, along with improved Vanilla duck-type AI  
     Golden critters: Seagull, Duck, Flamingo
	 Frogs: 3 types of poison dart frogs, and you can craft poison ammo with them!

In plans:

    More golden critter variants (penguin, snail)
    Golden (animal-like) enemies :O
    More birds (including as enemies)
    More frogs and other herps
	More fishes
    Spider varieties.
    More butterflies and moths.

	Mechanics related to Zoologist and Bestiary: 

        Critter friendliness mechanic: they will be less likely to avoid players if they have Guide to Critter Companionship, luck is high or the kill count is low.  
        Encounter rewards: various new and vanilla items sold by Zoologist based on encounters.
