[c/0EFF0E:Natural Variety] is a new WIP personal project which will add real world variety to Terraria's animals (both critters and enemies). 

So far it adds:
     QoL Mechanics: Right click to release any critter from a cage (Terrarrium, Bowl, Bottle). (Might release as separate mod if requested)
	 Bird critter variants: Eurasian Jay, Blackbird, Goldfinch
     Duck variants: Pochard, along with improved Vanilla duck-type AI

    Duck varieties (Merganser, Red Duck)
    Grebe varieties (Great Crested, Little)
    Swans and possibly geese
    Vulture enemy varieties 
    Eagles and other raptors (as enemies which spawn in the sky) 
    Frog varieties and other Herps 
    Spider varieties (enemies)
    Butterflies and Moths (critter, enemy)
