[c/0EFF0E:Natural Variety] is a new WIP personal project which will add real world variety to Terraria's animals (both critters and enemies). 

So far it adds:
     QoL Mechanics: Right click to release any critter from a cage (Terrarrium, Bowl, Bottle). (Might release as separate mod if requested)
	 
     Bird critter variants: Eurasian Jay, Blackbird, Goldfinch
     Duck variants: Pochard and Ferruginous Duck, along with improved Vanilla duck-type AI  
     Golden critters: Seagull

In plans:

    More golden critter variants. 
    Golden (animal-like) enemies :O
    More songbirds.
    Owl varieties. 
    Duck-like varieties (Coots, Cormorants, Grebes).
    Swans and possibly geese.
    Vulture enemy varieties. 
    Eagles and other raptors (as harpy-like enemies)
    Frog varieties and other Herps. 
    Spider varieties (enemies).
    Butterflies and Moths (critter, enemy).

	Mechanics related to Zoologist and Bestiary: 
    
    See kill count in bestiary: every 50 by default, precise number with Tally Counter.
    Critter friendliness mechanic: they will be less likely to avoid players if they have Guide to Critter Companionship, luck is high or the kill count is low.  
    Encounter rewards. For example: find all birds species to get Finch Staff from Zoologist.
