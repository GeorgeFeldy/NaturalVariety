	Mechanics related to Zoologist and Bestiary: 
    
    See kill count in bestiary: every 50 by default, precise number with Tally Counter.
    Critter friendliness mechanic: they will be less likely to avoid players if they have Guide to Critter Companionship, luck is high or the kill count is low.  
    Encounter rewards: various new and vanilla items sold by Zoologist based on encounters.
